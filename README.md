In this system, the user will be able to perform
the following tasks:

1- Checking account balance
2- Withdraw Money.
3- Deposit Money.

The name of the bank users who would be able to access the ATM system has to be stored on persistent
storage (i.e., names stored on a file). Thus, each time the system is started, it will read the list of bank
users with their associated information.

Each bank user must have a first name, last name, email, card number (9 digits), pin code (4 digits)
stored, and initial balance. The card number and the pin code will be used to verify the user's identity
before being able to complete an ATM transaction.
